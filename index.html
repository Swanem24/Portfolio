                <p>Hello, My name is Sanjog Wanem. I am a Computer Science graduate from University of Portsmouth. <br>
                    Currently, I am looking for a front end developer role. I am constantly learning and challenging myself by taking up a courses on programming language <br>
                    or working on a small project. To prepare for front end role I have learnt HTML, CSS and Javascript languages. I have started learning React and <br>
                    working on projects that includes the use of React. <br>
                    As a hobby I create small-scale games using Unity Engine and publishing it. Up till now I have published three games, a platform game, shooting game <br>
                    and a click and drag game.
